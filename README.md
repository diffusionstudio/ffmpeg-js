# 🎥 FFmpeg.js: A WebAssembly-powered FFmpeg Interface for Browsers

Welcome to FFmpeg.js, an innovative library that offers a WebAssembly-powered interface for utilizing FFmpeg in the browser. 🌐💡

## Demo

[Open Demo Application](https://ffmpeg-js-preview.vercel.app/)

## ❓ Why FFmpeg.js?

This project has been inspired by the awesome work of [ffmpeg.wasm](https://github.com/ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm), but we noted a few drawbacks that might limit its applicability for broader use:

1. The project employs a GPL3 build of FFmpeg, limiting its use for commercial projects. 🚫💼
2. It's developed in JavaScript and hence offers limited typing, restricting the potential for more rigorous static type checks. ❗⌨️
3. The lack of an object-oriented approach for writing FFmpeg commands. 🔄📝

## ✔️ FFmpeg.js to the Rescue!

Addressing the issues above, FFmpeg.js:

- Provides an LGPL build of FFmpeg, making it commercially more viable, checkout https://ffmpeg.org/legal.html for more detail. 🟢💼
- Is written in TypeScript, introducing static type checking to enhance code reliability. 👌🔍
- Offers an object-oriented interface for writing FFmpeg commands, inspired by `fluent-ffmpeg`
  , making it more programmer-friendly. 🎯🔄

However, it's important to note that as of now, FFmpeg.js runs only in Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browsers. It doesn't support Safari or Node. 🚧🔍

## 🚀 Setup

Setting up FFmpeg.js is a breeze!

```bash
npm i @diffusion-studio/ffmpeg-js
```

This should install the library. Now because ffmpeg.js requires the use of the [SharedArrayBuffer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer) you need to enable `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` and `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp` on the server side.

### ⚡️Vite

In a vite environment you can simply add these policies by putting the following into your `vite.config.js`:

```js
...
server: {
    ...
    headers: {
      'Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy': 'require-corp',
      'Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy': 'same-origin',
    },
},
...
```

### △Next.js

Here is an example `next.config.js` that supports the SharedArrayBuffer:

```
module.exports = {
    async headers() {
        return [
            {
                source: '/',
                headers: [
                    {
                        key: 'Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy',
                        value: 'require-corp',
                    },
                    {
                        key: 'Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy',
                        value: 'same-origin',
                    },
                ],
            },
        ];
    },
};
```

## 💻 Usage

Somewhere in your project you need to initiate a ffmpeg instance.

```typescript
import { FFmpeg } from '@diffusion-studio/ffmpeg-js';

const ffmpeg = new FFmpeg();
```

By default this will pull a [LGPLv2.1 compliant build](https://github.com/diffusion-studio/ffmpeg-wasm-lgpl-build) of FFmpeg from the [UNPKG delivery network](https://www.unpkg.com).<br> Consequently if you immidiately intent to run commands you need to wait until the binaries have been fetched successfully, like this:

```typescript
ffmpeg.whenReady(async () => {
  await ffmpeg.exec(['-help']);
});
```

This will output the ffmpeg help as fast as possible.

> HINT: Even though this library intends to provide a object oriented interface for ffmpeg, you can still run commands manually using the `exec` method.

When working with files you need to save them to the in-memory file system first:

```typescript
const source = 'https://<path to file>/<filename>.mp4';

// write to file system
await ffmpeg.writeFile('input.mp4', source);

// convert mp4 to avi
await ffmpeg.exec(['-i', 'input.mp4', 'output.avi']);

// read from file system
const result: Uint8Array = ffmpeg.readFile('output.avi');

// free memory
ffmpeg.deleteFile('input.mp4');
ffmpeg.deleteFile('output.avi');
```

Let's see how you would get the same result the **object oriented** way.

```typescript
const source = 'https://<path to file>/<filename>.mp4';

const result: Uint8Array | undefined = ffmpeg
  .input({ source })
  .ouput({ format: 'avi' })
  .export();
```

> If you were wondering, yes the memory is being managed for you.

## 📖 Examples

Take a look at these tests for more examples:

- https://github.com/diffusion-studio/ffmpeg-js/blob/main/tests/export.spec.ts
- https://github.com/diffusion-studio/ffmpeg-js/blob/main/tests/commands.spec.ts

## 🛑 Limitations

- Webassembly is limited to 2GB
- Difficult to handle in unit tests, it's probably best if you mock the FFmpeg class and leave the testing to us (which is also good practice).
- There is no hardware acceleration available, making video encoding/decoding rather slow.

## ⚙️ Configurations

Currently there are two different FFmpeg configurations available with more on the way.

- `lgpl-base` (default): It is a compilation of FFmpeg without any external libraries, which is useful for audio & video muxing/demuxing and audio encoding/decoding. It is v2.1LGPL compliant and can therefore be used for commercial projects.
- `gpl-extended`: This is the [@ffmpeg/core](https://github.com/ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm-core) configuration, that has been built with `--enable-gpl` and `--enable-nonfree` and can therefore only be used for commercial projects if the entire codebase is publicly accessible. It supports popular delivery codecs such as `h264/h265/vp9` etc.

For more information about the supported codecs and muxers run the following commands:

```typescript
console.log(await ffmpeg.codecs());
console.log(await ffmpeg.formats());
```

This is how you can switch the configuration:

```typescript
import {
  FFmpeg,
  FFmpegConfigurationGPLExtended,
} from '@diffusion-studio/ffmpeg-js';

// FFmpegConfigurationGPLExtended will add the type extensions
const ffmpeg = new FFmpeg<FFmpegConfigurationGPLExtended>({
  config: 'gpl-extended',
});
```

Thats it!

We believe that FFmpeg.js will significantly streamline your interaction with FFmpeg in the browser, providing a more effective and efficient coding experience. Happy coding! 🚀🌟
